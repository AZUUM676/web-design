To style elements in HTML,
 you can use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).
  CSS allows you to control the appearance of HTML elements
   by specifying rules that define how they should look.
    You can apply CSS styles to elements using various methods:
 1)  Inline Styles:  You can apply styles directly to an element using the style attribute.
  For example: <p style="color: blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>

2) Internal Stylesheet: You can define styles within the <style> tags in the <head> section of your HTML document.
 For example: 
 <head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>


3) External Stylesheet:You can create a separate CSS file with .css extension and link it to your HTML document 
using the <link>
