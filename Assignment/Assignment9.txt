Carousel item and carousel inner are typically used in web 
development to create carousel 
components that allow you to display multiple images or 
slides in a rotating manner on a webpage. 

- Carousel Inner: It's like the container that
 holds all the carousel items together. It manages 
 the layout and positioning of the carousel items
  within the carousel component. Think of it as the main
   structure that organizes how the carousel items are displayed.

- Carousel Item: These are the individual slides
 or images within the carousel. Each carousel item 
 represents a distinct piece of content that you want
  to display in the carousel. The carousel item holds the 
  
  specific content like images, text, or
   other media that you want to showcase to your webpage visitors.
