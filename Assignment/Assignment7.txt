Assignment 7 was about adding navigation on our working project
here is theoretical way on how to add navigations on a pages

Define Navigation Structure: Before adding navigation to pages,
 outline the website's structure.
 Determine the main sections and sub-sections,
  prioritizing user experience and logical flow.

Choose Navigation Elements: Select appropriate
 navigation elements based on the 
website's complexity and user needs.
 Common options include:

Header Navigation: A horizontal bar at the top of
 the page with links to main sections.
Sidebar Navigation: A vertical menu on the side of the page for quick access to sub-sections.
Footer Navigation: Links placed at the bottom of the page for additional
 navigation or contact information.
Create Navigation Links: For each page, include links to relevant 
sections in the navigation menu.
 Use clear and descriptive anchor text to guide users.
