The difference between 
front-end and back-end is like the difference between 
what you see and what happens behind the scenes.

Front-end development focuses on the part of a website or
 application that users interact with directly.
 It includes designing and building the user interface,
  handling user interactions, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Back-end development, on the other hand, deals with the behind-the-scenes 
functionality of a website or application. 
It involves managing databases, handling server-side logic,
 and ensuring that data is processed and delivered to the front-end.


When it comes to front-end development, there are several

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

 JavaScript


  three technologies commonly used in backend development:
Python, JavaScript (Node. js), Ruby.
