To define constants in PHP, you can use the define() function.
 Constants are identifiers (names) for values that remain 
 the same throughout the execution of a script. Here are
  three examples of defining constants in PHP:

php
// Example 1: Define a constant for the value of pi
define("PI", 3.14159);

// Example 2: Define a constant for the maximum number of login attempts
define("MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS", 3);

// Example 3: Define a constant for the name of the shoe store
define("STORE_NAME", "MyShoeStore");


In the examples above, define() is used to create constants with names
 (e.g., PI, MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS, STORE_NAME) and corresponding values. 
 Once defined, constants cannot be changed or
 redefined during the script's execution.
